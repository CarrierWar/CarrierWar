# CarrierWar
There were hundreds of highly detailed, board based war games created in the '70's and '80's (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2529/flat-top).

These have largely disappeared over the years as games moved to desktop computers but last most of their detailed game mechanics
in favor of graphics and arcade style gameplay.

Carrier War is an attempt to recreate a style of naval based game as a multi-player, Azure based simulation that runs in real time. 
I don’t have a detailed form the game could take. But imagine getting a page at 2:30AM letting you know that your carriers have
been spotted by a submarine and if you don’t get on line and start issuing orders you can kiss those Flat Tops goodbye.

It's also a chance for me to work on my C# skills and I come over from VB.Net, interact with other programmers and design a green field
application for Azure that takes advantage of its scalability features.
